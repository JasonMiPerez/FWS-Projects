# FWS-Projects

This is my GITHUB repository for projects i'm working on for my FWS Research Assistanship Program at CCNY

I'll update this repository as I go.

NOTE: Decimal values cannot be entered into the terminal when running the Guassian Elimination program, however the prograam does ouput decimal values and stores the values as floating point types.
