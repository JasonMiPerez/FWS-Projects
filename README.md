# FWS-Projects

This is my GitHub repository for projects I'm working on for my FWS Research Assistantship Program at CCNY

I'll update this repository as I go.

NOTE: Decimal values cannot be entered into the terminal when running the Gaussian-Elimination program, however, the program does output decimal values and stores the values as floating point types.
